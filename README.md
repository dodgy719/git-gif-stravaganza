## Guided Git GIF-STRAVAGANZA

Today's challenge is to contribute to a Git repository, using branches and pull requests! We'll be using a Git branching workflow so we can all contribute to this README file.

## Steps

1. Accept the invite to collaborate on this repository (should be an email sent to the email address associated with your GitHub account - will be sent out at the start of the Guided Session)
2. Clone down this repository (**don't fork it!**) to a good place on your computer
3. Create a new branch on your local repository (I recommend naming your branch after yourself, so my branch will be named abhineet)
4. Find a GIF or image that summarizes how you're feeling today
5. Use Markdown syntax and a text editor to add the GIF or image to this README.md file under your name
6. Add and commit your local changes to your branch
7. Push your branch to this repository (this step will not work if you forgot to checkout a branch in step 2!)
8. Start a pull request for me to review
9. I will either accept your pull request, or send you feedback on what you need to do to improve!
